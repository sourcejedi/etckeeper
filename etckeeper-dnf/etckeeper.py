        # Normally py2 breaks if you print arbitrary unicode when stdout is
        # not a tty (UnicodeEncodeError).  However the dnf cli has a
        # workaround; it will survive regardless of what we do.
        #
        # Then we have logging.FileHandler.  In py3 it will use
        # locale.getpreferredencoding(False) by default.  This should match
        # the default locale, unless we are on py < 3.2, AND the program
        # forgot to call setlocale(LC_ALL, "").  dnf already calls
        # setlocale(LC_ALL, ""), so it will be nice and consistent.
        # In fact it is the dnf *library* that calls setlocale, this is not
        # really recommended, but it makes me pretty confident here.
        #
        # errors='replace' means that decode errors give us '\ufffd', which
        # causes UnicodeEncodeError in some character encodings.  Let us
        # simulate a round-trip through errors='replace', by replacing them
        # with a question mark.
        #
        # The story for py2 is more complex.  In libdnf 2.6.3, the logfile
        # is equivalent to hardcoding a utf8 encoding.  That is survivable
        # (and if it changes to match py3, it will also be fine).
